# Cook-Pal

WIP - this file will be updated when the project is finished.
The idea is to build a recipe web app with various functionalities, including user authentication.

## Overview
- I have selected a free [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1218104730269490175), however I will still customize it a bit to better suit my envisioned final result. Maybe replace/remove certain links, simplify the footer, etc;
- Users will have to register/log in to be able to access additional sections of the website, i.e. "custom meal plan", "grocery list", perhaps a favorite recipes section, etc. Unregistered users will still be able to browse and search for recipes, but will not have access to the said sections;
- Recipe data will be pulled from TheMealAPI. Perhaps I will switch to another API later on, will have to test things out and see if I like it;
- I will be learning styled components, redux and firebase as I go along with the project (learning by building things approach);
- I will forget to eat while trying to fix my own damn bugs. Let the hunger games begin!
