# Cook-Pal

A recipe fetching app with user authentication, created mainly for the purpose of learning new things and practicing writing cleaner code with the guidance of my mentor [Ieva Kaleginiene](https://github.com/kaleginiene) who has kindly reviewed my pull requests.

I have chosen a free [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1218104730269490175) for the visualization of the project, however I had to modify it based on the limits of the API used in the app.

## Features:
- Filter recipes by category and area;
- Search for recipes by name or partial name;
- One random recipe suggestion is generated every day;
- User login/registration functionality which allows logged in users to access the favorites and grocery list pages;
- Grocery lists and saved recipes of each user are stored in Firebase;
- All recipe data is fetched from [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

## What I learned during this project:
- Firebase (authentication, Firestore database);
- Redux Toolkit for state management;
- Styled components, as well as better overall organization of CSS;
- This was my first project where I used Axios instead of Fetch;
- Enums to avoid using hardcoded values;
- And the most important thing â€“ to appreciate code reviews!
